# Vintage Tastebuds - Algorithm Practice

Welcome to the **Vintage Tastebuds** repository! This repo is a collection of algorithms and data structures implemented in preparation for coding interviews, particularly with MANG (Meta, Apple, Netflix, Google) companies.

## Project Overview

This repository serves as a yearly practice platform where I regularly implement and refine various algorithms and data structures. The goal is to maintain a high level of preparedness for technical interviews with top tech companies.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To work with this repository, you'll need:

- A modern code editor (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA)
- A working installation of Python (or the language of your choice)
- Familiarity with basic command-line operations

### Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vintage-tastebuds.git
cd vintage-tastebuds
```

### Running the Code

Each algorithm or data structure is organized into its own file. You can run any script using:

```bash
python3 <filename>.py
```

For example:

```bash
python3 sort_algorithms/quick_sort.py
```

## Directory Structure
